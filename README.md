[![CI](https://github.com/giavinh79/portfolio-new/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/giavinh79/portfolio-new/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a new portfolio website I am creating using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve on the initial design, create a faster and more maintainable React.js app, and became more familiar with this tool (React.js framework which uses SSR & SSG for better performance and SEO). My older portfolio website (hosted [here](https://eloquent-bhaskara-4b11e4.netlify.app/)) was originally made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This website is deployed on Vercel here: [https://giavinhlam.com](https://giavinhlam.com)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server (Node.js version >= 17):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to see the page.

## Linting

Add the ESLint extension and run this command to check for problems:

```bash
npm run lint
```
